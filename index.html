  <p>I am a colombian Industrial Engineer. I have worked in different areas but always related to IT, working hand in hand with Systems engineers most of the time in the Health and Care sector.
    Back in Colombia I decided to combine my work with my passion in entrepreneurship, so I participated in courses , bootcamps and programs to learn a little more about innovation and business models. After that I traveled to Barcelona to do a
    postgraduate in International Economy to have a global business vision.
    I worked on my own entrepreneurs tech projects for a while but i didn’t go well, that’s when i decided to come to Atlanta and try in a better environment for startups than Colombia, and I launched Shopylive App, with this project i learned that
    entrepreneurship is not just about having a good idea, is also about having a great business model, a validation process, and an entrepreneurship ecosystem that helps you to get your dream come true. That's when I made the decision to take the
    Product Manager nanodegree program in Udacity so I can not just implement all what I am learning in my projects but help other entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams in a better way.
